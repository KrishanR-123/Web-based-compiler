# Web-based-compiler
The compiler is a program that reads a program written in one language, called the source language, and converted it into another language called the target language. It helps in reporting errors detected during the translation of source code to target code. <br><br>

  :star: Star us on GitHub — it helps!<br><br>
  ***This repository walks you through the process of making Compiler from Scratch.***
## Why we choose this as our Minor Project?<br>
  - [We will use this compiler in solving real-time problems by connecting it to our start-up’s web-app.]()
  - [We will learn about abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and how one program can manipulate other programs.]()
  - [We will learn about assembly and all the low-level details of how computers.]()
  - [We will polish our skills in C language.]()
	    
## Language Used: "C"
C is a high-level language that still allows us to do dip into assembly language which is a low-level language.

# Lexical Analysis<br>
Lexing or tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters (such as in a computer program or web page) into a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning). A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed a lexer, tokenizer, or scanner, although the scanner is also a term for the first stage of a lexer.<br><br>

# Syntax Analysis<br>
Parsing, syntax analysis, or syntactic analysis is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar. <br><br>

# Semantic Analysis<br>
The semantic analysis phase checks the source program for semantic errors and gathers type information for the subsequent code-generation phase. It uses hierarchical structure determined by the syntax-analysis phase to identify the operators and operands of expressions and statements.<br><br>The sem


# Intermediate Code Generation<br>
Intermediate code generator receives input from its predecessor phase, semantic analyzer, in the form of an annotated syntax tree. That syntax tree then can be converted into a linear representation, e.g., postfix notation. Intermediate code tends to be machine independent code.<br><br>

# Code Optimization<br>
The code optimization phase attempts to improve intermediate code, so that faster-running machine code will result. There is a great variation in the amount of code optimization different compilers perform. In those that do the most, called “optimizing compilers,” a significant amount of the time of the compiler is spent on this phase.<br><br>

# Machine Code Generation<br>
The final phase of the compiler is the generation of target code, consisting normally relocatable machine code or assembly code. Memory locations are selected for each of the variables used by the program. Then, intermediate instructions are each translated into a sequence of machine instructions that perform the same task.<br><br>
